hasqap
======

This project is a loose vala-implementation of the HAS-QAP algorithm as presented in the following paper:

ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/luca/papers/tr-idsia-4-97.pdf

It's intended use was to optimize keyboard layouts as this is a problem which can (more or less) been formulated as a quadratic assignment problem..

Building
--------

This project is build with [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/). Install all necessary vala-packages and development-files (valac, libgee, â€¦).

If you have checked out for the first time run:

`tup init`

To build the project simply run:

`tup upd`


Usage
-----

Either use the library from your application or use the executable generated in the build process like this:

`./solver 100 < problem.dat`

where "100" is the number of iterations to perform and "problem.dat" is a [qaplib-formatted problem](http://www.opt.math.tu-graz.ac.at/qaplib/inst.html).

It should generate output similar to the following (run performed on the nug30-problem):

The output consists of the best permutations found so far and their cost. Note that these permutations are zero-indexed (in opposition to the solutions in qaplib).
